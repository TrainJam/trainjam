# TrainJam

A group of people interested in software retreats, and trains! Background on the [Fission forum](https://talk.fission.codes/t/trainjam-2023/4789).

## Why TrainJam?

> We’ve seen at Gradient Retreat that there’s something magical about spending a few days completely apart from the routines and obligations of your regular life and job, with a group of like-minded people, where you can allow yourself to indulge in a level of creative focus and exploration that’s just not accessible at home.

> There’s also something magical about trains. What could be better than combining the two?

I believe open source is essential, but not good enough. Some additional invariants:
* Software should reward curiosity, be easy for outsiders to unfold.
* If you can use a program, you should be able to modify the program. No installing additional tools.
* Good software is stable software. It updates infrequently, and updates are considered optional.

Some links to my projects in service of these beliefs:
* https://akkartik.name/freewheeling -- dense, scripted, kinda-theoretical 20-minute talk elaborating on my beliefs and showing how I currently satisfy my invariants
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD6vmbmzdBo -- more spontaneous, relaxed, crappy demo on how my approach works in practice, and how my various little tools compose together in practice
* https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=94852 -- newest experiment: expanding my tools to support mobile devices

For TrainJam I'd be quite pleased to _not_ hack on any of my projects. My priorities:
* Take in the sights. I love trains and have suffered a train deficit for the past 25 years.
* Be available to anyone interested in playing with my projects. If this stuff seems interesting, you might want to prepare for TrainJam by installing [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) on your preferred devices. Expected time burden: 5 minutes. (Please buttonhole me and tell me if this was optimistic!)
* Try out your projects as a way to get to know you.
