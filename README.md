# TrainJam

A group of people interested in software retreats, and trains! Background on the [Fission forum](https://talk.fission.codes/t/trainjam-2023/4789).

## Why TrainJam?

> We’ve seen at Gradient Retreat that there’s something magical about spending a few days completely apart from the routines and obligations of your regular life and job, with a group of like-minded people, where you can allow yourself to indulge in a level of creative focus and exploration that’s just not accessible at home.

> There’s also something magical about trains. What could be better than combining the two?
